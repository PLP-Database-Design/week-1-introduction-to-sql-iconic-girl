Question 1.
Compents of a Database Management system
1)Hardware -refers to the physical devices used to store and process data in the DBMS
2)Software-the actual DBMS software
 that controls and manages the database
 3)Data -the most crucial component
 4)Database Schema-the logical structure of the data base
 5)Query processor-Translates user queries written in SQL into instructions understood byy the database engine
 6)Database Engine-the core component responsible for storing,retriving and updating data
 7)Transaction Mnager-ensures that all database transactions are executed correctly
 8)Security Manager-Handel user authentication access control and encryption
 9)Backup and Recovery Manager- ensures data is recoverable in case of faillures like crashes
10) User interface-tools or applications that allow users to interact with the DBMS


Question 2:
relational database is atype of database that stores data in structured tableswith rows and columns where the relationship is maintained by keys

question 3:
Classification of sql :
1.Data definition language-used to define and modify database structure

2. Data manipulation Language-deals with data manipulation and retrival

3. Data Control Language-Manages user permission and access control

question 4

difference between primarykey and foreign key
A)Primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table while foreign keysestablish a relationship between two tables
B)primary key always cannot contain duplicates while Foreignkeys may contain duplicates in the referencing table
C)Primarykeys cannot be null while foreign keys can contain null if not enforced strictly 
D}Primary keys ensures entity inegrity while foreign keys ensures referential integrity

Question 4:
Entity-Relationship Diagram is a graphical representation of the entities in a database and the relatioships between them


Question 5:
Advantages of Relational Database
1.Data integrity enforces rules to ensure accurcy and consistency of data
2.Flexibility east to modify and update data without altering the overall structure
3.Scalability can handle large amounts of data and complex queries effeciently
4.Data security offers robust access control and user permissions

Question 6 :
Types of Data Types used in tables
1.Integer:stores whole numbers
2.varchar:stores variable-length strings
3.Date/Time:stores date and time information
4.Boolean:stores true or false values

question 7:
Purpose of Database Management System :
Data Organization
Data security
Data integrity
Efficiency
Concurrency Management
